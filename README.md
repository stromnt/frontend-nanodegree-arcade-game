##Playing the Game
The aim of the game is to reach the water without being hit by a bug.
- The bugs will randomly appear in different rows.
- If you reach the water you will clock up a **win** and the bugs will speed up.
- If you collide with a bug, your score will drop by 1 and the bugs will slow slightly.
- The console will continuously report on your score - negative scoring applies.
- It the game becomes too fast to play press <kbd>F5</kbd> to reset the game.

**_Have Fun_**
